          <h3>this is the first song</h3>
          <p>I didn't want to be the one to forget
             I thought of everything I'd never regret
             Let's run with it because it's all we can take
             One thing I'd never see, the same way around
             I don't believe it and it slips from the ground
             I want to take you to that place near the rush
             But no one gives us any time anymore
             He ask me once if Iâ€™d look in on his dog
             You made an offer for it, then you ran off
             I got this picture of us kissin' in my head
             And all I hear is the last thing that you said
          </p>

          <h3>and this is the other one</h3>
          <p>Run run, ditto moon
             Pullin' back, shape up to
             The know
             High stream, pushing steam
             Rolling eye is forced to dream, you go
             All I want to know is how to start over again
             You want it?
             All I need to know is how to gain control
             Of the shapeless soul

             [Chorus]
             Oh, you sit amongst yourselves
             Soon, you lie under ecstasy
             Your eye has stolen me
             Oh, you sit amongst yourselves
             Soon, you lie under ecstasy
             Your eye is switchin' with it

             [Verse 2]
             Run run, ditto moon
             Pullin' back, shape up to
             The know
             High stream, pushing steam
             Rolling eye is forced to dream, you go
             All I want to know is how to start over again
             You want it?
             All I need to know is when you start to control
             Of the shapeless soul
           </p>
